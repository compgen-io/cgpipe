cgpipe - HPC/HTC analysis pipelines 
-----------------------------------
Usage: cgpipe {opts} {args} {target1 target2...}

Options:
    -f filename   Pipeline script filename (local or remote, required)
    -h            Show help for pipeline
    -l logfile    Log debug messages here
    -o outfile    Write all printed lines to this file
    -j joblog     Output a summary of submitted jobs 
                  (and their outputs, jobids, etc)

    -dr           Dry run (Don't actually build targets)
    
    -v            Verbose logging
    -s            Silence writing to console
    -nolog        Suppress logging to stderr
    
    -license      Show the license information
    

    Additional pipeline-specific arguments can be set by using the format:
        --foo bar --arg one --arg two
    
    This will set the variable "foo" to be "bar", and "arg" to be a list:
    ["one", "two"]. These variables can then be used by the pipeline script.

    The pipeline script can either be a local file or a remote pipeline. By
    default the compgen.io pipeline repository is available at:
    compgen_io:path/to/script
    
    For more details about remote repositories, check the README.md file.
    

Note: If no target is specified, the first target in the file will be used


Additional commands:
	cancel-pending     Cancel pending jobs from a job-log
	show-pending       Show pending/running jobs from a job-log
	status             Show the status for all output files
	vaccuum            Clean up a job-log (keep only the newest record for any output)
