# In this workflow, there are three files. Two inputs and one output. Assume the inputs are generated 
# by a single job.
#
# The final output only depends on one of these inputs. However, there is an external process that updates
# the second input.
#
# In this scenario, no jobs should be sumbmitted, as the final exists (and is older than it's input).
